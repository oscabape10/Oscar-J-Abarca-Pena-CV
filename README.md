A front end Developer looking to switch careers from Finance to Web Development.
I studied an Industrial Engineering degree at UNI (National Universty of Engineering) Managua, Nicaragua. In 2002 I moved to London to improved and master my English as a language leading to persue a career in Finance. Through the years since, I have worked as Accountant and Financial Analyst in many companies and Financial Services around London including a top four accountancy firm, from blue-chip companies to startups and FinTech (HSBC-PWC-TOG-Strategy&-Funding Circle-BGC Partners).

Having been working as a Finance Analyst for the past 6 years, my career lead me to realize that it will be necessary to learn VBA coding as a language to automate my work in Excel, subsequently this gave me a flavour in coding, taking an interest in Web development.
